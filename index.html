      <h4>My Purpose</h4>
      <p>My name is Lelouch vi Britannia and many of you may know me as
        Lelouch of the Rebellion from my famous tv show Code Geass which
        documented my success in overthrowing our corrupt government.
        All that aside, I am a family man now and I am also running for
        Constable right here in Fayette County District 1. I will no longer be
        leading any more coup d'etats.</p>

  <h5 class="card-title">My Expertise</h5>
  <p class="card-text">My main plan of action for bringing peace to our community
    involves the use of Geass, also known as the King's Power. With this power,
    I will be able to persuade any criminal to walk the straight and narrow,
    no matter how hardened he is in his life of crime. It will only work once,
    so if they are somehow able to break free then do not fear, I have Plan B!</p>

<div class="card-body">
  <h5 class="card-title">Plan B</h5>
  <p class="card-text">Unlike my power of Geass, I do have a skill that took many
    years to perfect and I believe it will greatly benefit this community.
    My skill and grace with operating the extremely high-tech Knightmare robots
    will keep our streets safe. With enough funding I would be able to implement a
    training program for our police force so that our Men in Blue will no longer
    face any danger.</p>

  <div class="col-12 col-md-8 bg-danger"><h4 class="text-justify">My Promise to Fayette County</h4>
    <p>All impressive skills aside, my role in this community will be much more
      than bringing criminals to justice and related activities.
      A large portion of my time would be spent helping to build and improve on
      this community. With my past government experience, I can bring us to a higher
      level of economic bliss. Coming from a family which is headed by my father ,
      Charles zi Britannia, who is the 98th emperor of Britannia, I would know more than
      anyone what it takes to reach a state of wealth that will last.<p>
